web_scraping for information:
    same as before just import into sqlite3
    take that info and push to gpread file


build database again with sqlite3
    so that it can be used cross platform
        embed automatic push/pull to/from gspread

    tables of separate assemblies
    tables for grades for separate assemblies

    use same id scheme: [assemb#][sen/rep][last[0:3]][district#]

figure out how to do it with PILLOW
    1. create config file
        - to keep it flexible
        includes:
            a. colors
            b. locations ([0,0] is top left)
            c. fonts and sizes
    2. figure out font shit

create gui:
    1. show data
    2. input/update data from manual input
    3. input/update data from spread
    4. create single/batch grade sheet


package it all up
    - with sqlite3, tkinter, the font/s, gspread, os
