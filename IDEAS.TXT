$$DONE!$$
web_scraping for information:
    same as before just import into sqlite3
    take that info and push to gpread file


$$DONE!$$
build database again with sqlite3
    so that it can be used cross platform
        embed automatic push/pull to/from gspread

    tables of separate assemblies
        cols:
            id PRIMARY KEY,title,name,district,party,phone_num,email,leg_page,last,first,img_link
    tables for grades for separate assemblies
        cols:
            id PRIMARY KEY, last_updated, donations, rhetoric, voting

    use same id scheme: [assemb#][sen/rep][last[0:3]][district#]



figure out how to do it with PILLOW
    1. create config file
        - to keep it flexible
        includes:
            a. colors
            b. locations ([0,0] is top left)
            c. fonts and sizes
    2. figure out font shit

create gui:
    1. show data
    2. input/update data from manual input
    3. input/update data from spread
    4. create single/batch grade sheet


package it all up
    - with sqlite3, tkinter, the font/s, gspread, os, requests, bs4:BeautifulSoup, time
